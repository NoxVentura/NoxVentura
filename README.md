I've been interested in tech and the community that surrounds it since I was quite young. I've probably been tinkering with computers since pre-K which I'm told is distinctive.

## Tech Stack


  - üíª **Programming Languages**: C, Python, Java, Basic Assembly, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Scratch
  - üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & FrameWorks**: Version control systems (Git), RegEx, React Js, React Native, VS Code
- üí™ **Experience** with Android development, Arduino Programming, Databases, APIs, Web Dev and more.
- üêß **GNU/Linux** and **Open Source** enthusiast, general knowledge of CLI commands.
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Robofest 2017 Winner** [irobochakra-student-wins-international-event-in-florida-usa](https://yourcoimbatore.com/irobochakra-student-wins-international-event-in-florida-usa/)

## Projects

Compiling this list has been harder than I'd previously thought, considering that almost all of them are scattered and there are way too many for just trivial code projects. 
Here are a few of the ones I could find:
- üíª **Youtube Feed Downloader**: Like many, I spend way too much time on YouTube, a lot of that is due to the algorithms that work together to keep you in the website watching everything all the time. I made a bot that downloads all of the youtube videos from my subscriptions feed, that spans around 100 channels (this is not a flex, I need help). The bot downloads it depending on the config for the videos you want. The subscriptions are stored in a CSV file. All of the program is written in python. The downloader is a youtube-dl binary
- A few React Native apps with async storage and other examples, a script that just runs an update command on my computer using a package manager etc.
- React Js apps like weather apps, TodoLists, timers etc
- üíª **A WPM reader**: It displays any text you put in as individual words one after the other at the speed you set it at. Apparently helps with your reading speed. Anecdotally, the technique seems to work for me.

üõ†Ô∏è Currently working on acquiring more web dev knowledge, building an RSS reader to read blogs and such and working on dockers and cloud certifications in the near future.
